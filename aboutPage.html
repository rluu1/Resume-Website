            <h1> My name is Ryan Luu.</h1>
            <p> I am a current fourth year student out of Worcester Polytechnic Institute that 
            is pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science - with this experience I have worked on a team-project application for
            Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed a personal calendar prototype and a prototype for a city-wide
            Line Account for a city in Thailand. Recently this summer I have configured and designed a project managment portfolio in Jira for 
            IPG Photonics IT department.
